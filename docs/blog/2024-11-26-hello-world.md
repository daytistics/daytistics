I'm happy to introduce you Daytistics ðŸŽ‰, a new software which has the goal to improve your well-being and make our stressy life a little bit happier. 
We analyze automatically your activities using modern large language models like ChatGPT. Our software is fully open-source and self-hostable.

## Our Origin

Daytistics was founded in June 2024 by [Leo Gall](/blog/authors/lgall). He wanted to improve his own well-being and started to track his activities. 
He quickly realized that he could improve this process and started to develop Daytistics. 

## Our Visions

:::info

Unfortunately, we are not able to offer you a working version of Daytistics yet. We are still in the development phase and are working hard to bring you a first version as soon as possible.

:::

We want to offer a simple and intuitive interface to track your activities. You can add, edit and delete activities. An activity entry has a start- and end-time, as 
well as an activity and a short diary entry. We also want to offer multiple visualizations, like charts and calendars, to give you a
better overview of your activities. Using modern language models, we want to analyze your activities and give you suggestions on how to improve your well-being.

We also want to offer a self-hostable version of Daytistics. We believe that your data is yours and you should have full control over it. If you don't
want to host Daytistics yourself, you can use our hosted version. This version has a fair pay-as-you-go pricing model and we don't sell your data to 
third parties.

## Technical Stuff

:::tip

If you are not a technical person, you can skip this section.

:::

Daytistics is a full-stack web application. The frontend is built with Nuxt.js and the backend is built with FastAPI. 
We use PostgreSQL as our database and Docker for deployment. We also use modern language models like ChatGPT and Claude to analyze your activities.


## Conclusion

In the future we will publish a monthly recap of our progress.
