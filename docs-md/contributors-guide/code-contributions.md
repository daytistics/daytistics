### Process Overview

This section covers the process from opening an issue to submitting a pull request and having it reviewed and merged.

1. **Open an Issue**: If you find a bug or have a feature request, open an issue in the GitHub issue tracker. If you are unsure about whether the issue is a bug or a feature request, you can ask in the issue tracker or on our discord.
2. **Issue Triage**: The maintainers will review the issue and assign it to a milestone if it is a bug or a feature request. If the issue is a bug, the maintainers will try to reproduce it and determine its severity. If the issue is a feature request, the maintainers will discuss the feasibility and scope of the feature. After triaging the issue, the maintainers will label it with the appropriate tags.
3. **Work on the Issue**: If you want to work on an issue, assign yourself to the issue and start working on it. If you have questions or need help, you can ask on our discord.
4. **Testing & Linting**: Before submitting a pull request, make sure that your changes pass the tests and linting checks. You can run the tests and linting checks locally by following the instructions in the README.
5. **Submit a Pull Request**: When you are ready to submit your changes, open a pull request. The pull request should reference the issue it addresses and include a description of the changes. The maintainers will review the pull request and provide feedback. 
6. **Code Review**: The maintainers will review the code changes and provide feedback. The code review process may involve multiple rounds of feedback and revisions. The maintainers may ask you to make changes to the code before the pull request is merged.
7. **Merge the Pull Request**: Once the code changes have been reviewed and approved, the maintainers will merge the pull request. The pull request will be closed, and the changes will be included in the next release.
