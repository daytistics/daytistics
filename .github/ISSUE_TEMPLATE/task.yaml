        Thanks for your interest in Daytistics! ü™¥

        Tasks are issues, usually created by maintainers, that are usually used to integrate new features or improve existing ones. Tasks usually arise from discussions in the [ideas channel](https://github.com/orgs/daytistics/discussions/categories/ideas).

        **DO NOT** create a task unless
        - You are a core maintainer who has prior approval via discord/discussions
        - You have otherwise been given approval to post the tasks

        Otherwise, your post will be closed/deleted.
