        Thanks for your interest in Daytistics! ðŸª´

        This is a place for Daytistics contributors to find tasks that need to get done around the repository. Tasks are different than issues as they are generally related to providing a new feature or improving an existing feature. They are _generally_ not related to an issue. We recommend that you first familiarize yourself with smaller issues in our codebase before starting such a task.

        **DO NOT** create a task unless
        - You are a core maintainer who has prior approval via discord/discussions
        - You have otherwise been given approval to post the tasks

        Otherwise, your post will be closed/deleted.

        **Interested in Taking This?**

        If you're interested in completing this task and it hasn't already been taken, comment below and to let others know you're working on it. As you work through the task, I ask that you submit a draft pull request as soon as possible, and tag this issue so we can all collaborate as best as possible.
