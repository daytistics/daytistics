              <p><strong>Liability for Contents</strong></p>
              <p>The contents of our pages were created with utmost care. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy,
                completeness, or timeliness of the contents. As service providers, we are responsible for our own
                content on these pages according to § 7 Abs.1 TMG under the general laws. However, according to §§ 8 to
                10 TMG, we are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored external information or to investigate
                circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information
                according to general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the
                time of knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon becoming aware of such violations, we will remove
                these contents immediately.</p>

              <p><strong>Liability for Links</strong></p>
              <p>Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents we have no influence.
                Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or
                operator of the sites is always responsible for the contents of the linked sites. The linked sites were
                checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not identifiable at
                the time of linking. However, permanent control of the content of the linked sites is not reasonable
                without concrete evidence of a violation. Upon notification of violations, we will remove such links
                immediately.</p>

              <p><strong>Copyright</strong></p>
              <p>The contents and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German copyright
                law. The duplication, processing, distribution, and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of
                copyright require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this
